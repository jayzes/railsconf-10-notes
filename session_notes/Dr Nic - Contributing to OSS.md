## Dr. Nic - Contributing to OSS ##
* What do you make?  Tools, TM bundles, little things, first drafts
* Help or recreate - pitch in rather than rewrite
	* Nice to have your name as an author
	* Less responsibility to contribute than maintain
	* Visibility of contributions via blogs, announcements, etc.
	* Make friends (at conferences)
* Project teams - not necessarily exclusive
	* Just 'do' - add/fix/document what you want
	* Opportunity to express individuality
* Aim is to get things done
	* OSS is a tool box, spare parts box, free and delicious
* The 8 Steps (not magic, just convenient)

		* Circle of concern and circle of influence
	2.  Finding the source
		* Step 2b - Has anyone else fixed it already?
	3.  Checkout the source
	4.  Snoop around
		* Rake -T, etc.
	5.  Make changes
		* Add coverage tests

		* Add features
