## Sometimes you need to see how things work from an opposite point of view
* Chinese doctors - you pay only when you're healthy (to prevent sickness)
* 2-3-4-1 musical meter
* Upside-down map w/ new zealand and australia at the top

## Accents and Identify
* French accent story
* You can't hear your own accent to know how bad it is
* Works the same for programming languages - Java guys come to Rails with a serious accent

## Quirks
* Light switch story - waving a hand in front of a panel
* Quirks are only cool when you're used to them
* "Don't make me think" - enormous difference between observing quirks and having to use/get through them.  
* Not so charming when you need to use them.

## My PHP Framework
* CDbaby was cobbled together and quirky, but it worked
* Found Rails partway through

## Playing vs. Planning
* Present focus vs. future focus
* Predictably irrational - $20 bill auction
	* Easy to get on a path that doesn't lead you anywhere good
	* Fine when you're playing - good to be in the present moment
	* Another example is the management rat race - getting away from what you love not because you want to, but because you have to

## Is it fun for people to help you?
* If anyone else needs to learn this PHP framework, they're going to hate it because it's full of personal quirks
* Harry Harlow - monkey pinned door experiment - the monkeys wanted to figure out the puzzle right away during the acclimation period.  With no external motivaion.
	* Instrinsic motivation!
	* Only the monkeys started getting rewarded, they made more errors and got worse at solving puzzles
	* Lesson: for interesting problems, intrinsic motivation can be stronger than external motivations
* Candy or answers - for interesting questions, the answer can be worth more than any rewards

## Delegating: What would Branson do?
* Over 400 companies in the Virgin group - how does he do it?
* Constantly evaluating and funding ideas - like having unlimited time
	* Suddenly able to say yes to everything that seemed worth doing
	* But it's hard to let go

## Brain dump yet? - thoughts.pro
* Dancing guy video - lone nut -> first follower turns him into a leader -> third makes a crowd to hit the tipping point and it's no longer risky
	* nurture your followers as equals
	* glorify the action, not yourself
	* no movement without the first follower
	* best way to make a movement is to creatively follow and give a lone nut credibility

## Confabulate - fabricate plausible reasons for things we feel
* Brother/sister story
* For moral arguments, the feelings come first and the reasons come later (but are made up to support the feelings)
* Emotions are the elephant, rational self is the rider.  Ultimately, the elephant is going to do whatever it wants.  The rider can only coax in rational directions and avoid danger.
	* Easy to slip from guiding the elephant to making excuses for it
	* People believe what they believe, the reasons come after

## Intuition is the sum of everything you've learned
* "how we decide" book on neuroscience
* Primitive brain is good at making fast decisions
* Rational brain is much slower and younger (evolutionarily)
* Rational brain stores info into the emotional brain and wires a rule
* That's what makes the snap decisions work
	* Story about submarine blips in Desert Storm
	
## Hobby
* Can't really hire people to help with a hobby - you're doing it for your own sake, not as a means to an end

## 90% think they're better than average
* Easy to get caught up with looking good, so you never do anything good
* Easy to get caught up trying to do something great, so you never do anything at all
* Best way around it is to think of yourself as a beginner again.
